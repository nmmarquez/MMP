Covariates in $x_t$ include  
    - education at time of survey (time invariant)  
    - migrant cohort (birth year - 1950) (time invariant)
    - community share of household heads who were in the US (time invariant)  
    - Dummies for state of birth  
    - Community Population (time varying)  
    - Male Labor Force Participation (time varying)  
    - Percentage of municipality labor force earning more than double minimum wage (time varying)  
    - 1 period lagged annual number of mexican deported from US
